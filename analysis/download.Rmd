## Mouse brain (demo Stereo-seq v1.3 data)

We will be exploring a demo mouse brain dataset made public by STOmics:

![](assets/mmbrain.png "Stereo-seq mouse brain FF v1.3")

Although not required for this workshop, the raw data and additional demo 
datasets are available to download [here](https://en.stomics.tech/resources/demo-data/list.html).

SAW (Stereo-seq Analysis Workflow) v8.1 was run to generate several output files that
we will explore. The processed data will not be available indefinitely, however
later you will see how to regenerate it for yourself. TODO: link to notebook.

You can download the [SAW report here](https://filesender.aarnet.edu.au/download.php?token=a66ee3d9-c207-4f1d-8ce1-6f7045a6a67b&files_ids=23488227).

```

A primary output of SAW v8.1 is [visualization.tar.gz](https://filesender.aarnet.edu.au/download.php?token=a66ee3d9-c207-4f1d-8ce1-6f7045a6a67b&files_ids=23488224). We will be extracting this file and examining the contents.

> **Warning:** Relatively large file (4.9GB)!

```

## Mouse liver (published data)

For our later downstream analysis, we will be using the following 
anndata-compatible data file:  
[DY1_D0_stereo-seq.h5ad](https://filesender.aarnet.edu.au/download.php?token=1beae7a9-436e-4915-9e01-4f24360140aa&files_ids=23496582)

> **Warning:** Relatively large file (4.4GB)!

```{r}
# Download LISTA data

```

The above link is only temporarily available for this workshop, but the data will 
be available later on from [CNGBdb](https://ftp.cngb.org/pub/SciRAID/stomics/STDS0000059/Stereo-seq/DY1_D0_stereo-seq.h5ad).

This file is from [LISTA: LIver Spatio-Temporal Atlas](https://db.cngb.org/stomics/lista/), 
in which Stereo-seq to profile mouse liver homeostasis and  regeneration 
following partial hepatectomy over several time points. Our file is
from day 0, the first time point following hepatectomy. 

TODO: Matched single cell data is also available to download from [here]()
