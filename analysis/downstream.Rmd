## Examining the h5ad file

- We'll convert this into a Seurat-compatible object

## Cell type decomposition with RCTD


A feature of this particular dataset is matched single cell data. Having this information is fantastic as it gives a reference to perform cell type decomposition. The paper used [RCTD](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00830-w) for this.


Note: it is possible to do cell-type deconvolution without a reference, with methods such as SCDeconvolve

- TODO, maybe demonstrate some cleaning methods, e.g. [SpotClean](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30587-y)

The paper also has the code uploaded: https://github.com/haoshijie13/LISTA, https://github.com/haoshijie13/LISTA/blob/main/00.run_RCTD.R
