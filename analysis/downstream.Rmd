# Cell type decomposition with RCTD

A feature of this particular dataset is matched single cell data. Having this information is fantastic as it gives a reference to perform cell type decomposition.

Note: it is possible to do cell-type deconvolution without a reference, with methods such as SCDeconvolve


Robust decomposition of cell type
mixtures in spatial transcriptomics 

- todo, how to run this?

- also todo, maybe some of the cleaning methods...
